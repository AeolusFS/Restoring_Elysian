Instructions for playing:
- WASD or arrow keys to move character
- spacebar to interact with characters, environments, events
- hold shift to sprint
- you can use the mouse/trackpad to control the options menu
- for playing you will really only need to used the WASD/arrow keys and spacebar


- Please note that the MAC deployment was deployed on OS Catalina. It seems that as a .exe program with an unknown publisher, the game may not be given permission to write new files in any location by default. So you may have to run the executable with root permissions to save the game if you run into this issue.
- If you cannot create a save file for the game, you can press escape and play just without a save.

Basic Outline of Mechanics:
- the basic idea is about moving rocks in puzzles. Use spacebar when you are right
beside/infront of a rock (that can be moved) to move the rock away from player that they are facing.
